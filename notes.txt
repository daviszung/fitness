challenges:
-Learning the App router and more about server components
-Ensuring that the database connection was available 
before the route logic occurred
-Typically when I'm using react I could just store state in a useState,
but since we're working with multiple pages, and I want to take advantage
of the App router, I moved some state into session storage instead.

interesting things:
-I'm trying out gray-first-design, in which I don't use any colors other
than gray for the initial design and layout
